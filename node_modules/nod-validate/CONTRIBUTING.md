# Contributing

Hello! Thank you for your interest, and thank you for even opening this file.
I will try to be brief.


## Creating an issue

You are very welcome to open an issue if you are having any trouble, but please
do both of us a favour and create an example of the problem in
[jsfiddle](http:jsfiddle.net) or [codepen](http://codepen.io). You will of
course need to include `nod.js` in the example, so here is a link that you can
use: `https://rawgit.com/casperin/nod/master/nod.js`.

If you, for whatever reason, can not do this, then by all means, just submit
your issue anyway.


## Creating a pull request

Oh my god, you are awesome! I love you. No, really.

Here are some quick rules (that I just thought up, I will amend them as I think
of more):

* If your editor is not set up to use `.editorConfig`, then have a look and make
  sure that you abide by its rules. (4 spaces indenting, 80 characters line
  length, etc).
* `nod.js` meddles with the dom (unless you specifically tells it not to), but
  do not save state in the dom.
* Of course, try to use same naming convention, etc. as I have.
* Relax. Hit the button and wait for me to get back to you. :)

                            If your order came earlier, that means the stock unit you ordered was one of the ones the factory was already working on before you placed your order. At the time we do not know the progress of each unit the factory is currently working on. By placing a pre-order, you are placed on a priority list which is a first come first serve list.

                            Yes, you can cancel a pre-order as long as the pre-order has the standard stock specifications. Meaning, when you ordered it, you did not change the density and size of the stock unit. If the density or size were changed, then the pre-order is the final sale and cannot be cancelled.

                            Each installation lasts 6-8 weeks depending on the speed of the client's hair growth. You need to book your clients to do a re-taping and reinstallation service to move the tape in extension up to the root for the hair again. Depending on the quality of the hair, and the clients wearing and maintenance habits, the tape in extension can be reinstalled 3-6 times. We recommend 3 reinstallations for our 3A/4A hair extensions and 6 reinstallations for our 5A/6A hair extensions. Overall, 3A/4A tape in extensions will last 3-5 months and 5A/6A tape in extensions will last 6-10 months.

                            First, wash and dry your hair so your extensions last longer. Then part your hair at the back and apply the extension right near the scalp where your hair is parted. Take a thin portion of your hair and place it below the extension before applying another extension to sandwich it. Make sure to press the tape in extensions firmly for 10-20 seconds and then you're all set. Repeat the process for others.

                            Hair extensions tend to tangle so it's important to brush your hair regularly. When you take a shower, apply shampoo right at the roots of your hair extensions and work your way down. Apply conditioner, wash, and dry your hair with a towel carefully. Use a hair dryer to ensure none of your hair extensions are wet.

                            Tie your hair up so your extensions are in full view. Apply a non-chemical tape glue remover to the extension tape and let it seep for a bit before removing the extension. You can also apply the remover for any leftover residue on your hair. <a href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/toupee-wig-hair-system-blog/how-to-remove-clean-prep-tape-extensions/">Read More</a>

                        If your order came earlier, that means the stock unit you ordered was one of the ones the factory was already working on before you placed your order. At the time we do not know the progress of each unit the factory is currently working on. By placing a pre-order, you are placed on a priority list which is a first come first serve list.

                        Yes, you can cancel a pre-order as long as the pre-order has the standard stock specifications. Meaning, when you ordered it, you did not change the density and size of the stock unit. If the density or size were changed, then the pre-order is the final sale and cannot be cancelled.

                            Each installation lasts 6-8 weeks depending on the speed of the client's hair growth. You need to book your clients to do a re-taping and reinstallation service to move the tape in extension up to the root for the hair again. Depending on the quality of the hair, and the clients wearing and maintenance habits, the tape in extension can be reinstalled 3-6 times. We recommend 3 reinstallations for our 3A/4A hair extensions and 6 reinstallations for our 5A/6A hair extensions. Overall, 3A/4A tape in extensions will last 3-5 months and 5A/6A tape in extensions will last 6-10 months.

                            First, wash and dry your hair so your extensions last longer. Then part your hair at the back and apply the extension right near the scalp where your hair is parted. Take a thin portion of your hair and place it below the extension before applying another extension to sandwich it. Make sure to press the tape in extensions firmly for 10-20 seconds and then you're all set. Repeat the process for others.

                            Hair extensions tend to tangle so it's important to brush your hair regularly. When you take a shower, apply shampoo right at the roots of your hair extensions and work your way down. Apply conditioner, wash, and dry your hair with a towel carefully. Use a hair dryer to ensure none of your hair extensions are wet.

                            Tie your hair up so your extensions are in full view. Apply a non-chemical tape glue remover to the extension tape and let it seep for a bit before removing the extension. You can also apply the remover for any leftover residue on your hair. <a href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/toupee-wig-hair-system-blog/how-to-remove-clean-prep-tape-extensions/">Read More</a>

                            In general, we would recommend a hair extension length at a maximum of 3" to 4" inches more than your natural hair length, but it also depends on your personal preferences. We also recommend having your natural hair length be at least 4’’ to 5’’ inches long to help you conceal and blend the extensions into your hair.

                            Please note that there is a colour discrepancy between our 3A/4A extensions and the colour ring. The colour ring matches more to our 5A/6A extensions as they are made with premium Chinese hair. The 3A/4A extensions are made with a mix of Indian/Chinese hair so the colours are a little off, notably in the blondes due to the quality of the hair. We are currently working on swatches that better match the 3A/4A quality hair colours. Keep posted on latest product updates by subscribing to Superhairpieces.

                            <strong>Note:</strong> It may be best to have a professional install them for you. Make sure to clean your eye area with a cleanser first. Apply an eye patch to the lashes you aren’t applying yet (lower or upper) so they don't make contact as you apply the extensions on the other set of lashes. Brush the lashes you are applying extensions to so that none are tangled. Apply the lash extensions one by one using proper eyelash glue. Once they are bonded, allow the glue to dry for a couple of minutes. Repeat this process for the other set of lashes.

                            Both D and DD curls are types of lash extensions that are designed to produce a more curled look when applied on your natural lashes. The difference between them is simply that the DD has a tighter and more pronounced and dramatic curl compared to the D curl.

                            <strong>Note: </strong>It is best to have a professional remove them for your safety. Make sure to use an oil-free remover. There are two types of remover you can use -- the cream remover or the gel remover. The cream remover is more ideal for those with sensitive skin as it causes less irritation. Apply an eye patch to the lashes you aren’t removing yet (upper or lower). Using a cotton swab, apply the remover from the base of your natural lashes up to the extensions. Make sure the eyes are closed during this process. Try not to make contact with the skin or lash line. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the bonds to weaken. Gently slide them off with a cotton swab and they should come off easily. You can also use a tweezer but be careful as it can damage your natural lashes. Using fresh cotton swabs, remove any leftover remover on the natural lashes. Gently remove the eye patch and apply foam cleanser thoroughly to your lashes before rinsing. Repeat the process for the other set of lashes.

                                A hair replacement system — also known as a non-surgical hair replacement system — is any sort of hairpiece that replaces your thinning or balding hair. Examples of hair replacement systems include human hair wigs and men's toupees which not only conceal hair loss, but provide additional hair coverage to your scalp.

                            <p>Toupees — also known as partial wigs or half-wigs — are a type of hair replacement system designed to cover certain areas of the scalp but not the full head. These hairpieces are typically worn by men as they cover the main areas affected by male pattern baldness. Superhairpieces offers a wide range of natural looking, comfortable and durable men's toupees.</p>

                                For many men who deal with male pattern baldness, they simply accept their balding or thinning hair or go ahead and do a complete shave. While for many, the look can suit them, for others, they don't quite have the head shape for a completely bald look or they simply don't look as good in general, looking many years older than they are. This is where toupee wigs for men are extremely useful. For any balding man who misses their hair, men's hair pieces can instantly give them a full head of hair again. If installed and styled correctly, it will look extremely natural looking and realistic while providing them with a huge confidence boost. Hair systems can truly bring your life back and with Superhairpieces offering a wide range of men's toupees in various styles, sizes and colors, there is one out there for you!

                            <h3>Why are wigs better than a hair transplant?</h3>
                            <p>Hair transplants are one of the popular options for men dealing with hair loss. However, men's wigs, also known as toupees, hairpieces and hair systems, are a type of hair replacement system that provides a number of benefits compared to hair transplants. For one, you get instant results and don't have to wait a year to see any progress like with a hair transplant. It's also irreversible so if you don't like the hair system, you can simply take it off which is not the case with a botched hair transplant. It is also much cheaper, especially upfront, while there is no risk of infections either as it is a non-surgical hair replacement.</p>

                                A poly base toupee hair system — also known as a skin base hair system or thin skin hairpiece — is made of pure polyurethane material. The hair used is directly knotted onto the poly toupee and sealed off by layers of more clear poly skin. These hair systems are generally some of the thinnest and lightest bases with many offering a very natural and realistic look for the wearer.

                            <p>Poly skin toupees are generally very easy to install, maintain and remove in addition to being a very comfortable and lightweight invisible hair replacement option. They are ideal for those who don't have the time to deal with maintenance as well as those who prefer a hair system that offers a very natural look more than anything else, especially if they opt for the very thin skin hair systems such as the M111 or HD111 hairpieces Superhairpieces offer.</p>

                            <p>This depends on the particular poly base toupee but in general, most skin bases — especially thin skin — only last four to six weeks as they are more of a disposable hairpiece. This is because the thinner the skin base, the less durable it is. The M101, on the other hand, has a thickness of 8 mils and is the most durable skin base Superhairpieces offers with a medium to long durability.</p>

                                Because of how thin skin bases are, they are generally not breathable compared to lace or mono units. And so, it is not advised to wear skin bases in warm climates or if you are a very active person. However, not all hair systems that have poly are unbreathable. Many systems such as our M158 include a fusion of lace and poly with four lace windows on the top for breathability and poly on the perimeter for easy installation and maintenance.</p>

However, with the M111 and HD111, it is best to use glue given the thinness of their base material and the fact that tape could be seen through the base. Glue, meanwhile, is largely invisible and won’t seep into the poly base either which results in less cleaning required.</p>

                            <p>
                                Because of the poly material, skin base systems are also generally easy to install, maintain and remove compared to other bases which makes them perfect for first-time hair system wearers who are just starting their journey and/or don’t have time to worry about maintenance. Additionally, the poly material allows more room for error when applying adhesives such as wig tape or wig glue.

                                Hair toppers are a great option for women with thinning hair as it instantly conceals and covers specific areas on the top of the scalp that are thinning or partially balding. Additionally, they provide plenty of volume and density to your natural hair provided it is blended properly.

                                <li><strong>Do hair toppers cause hair loss?</strong> Hair toppers should not have any effect on your hair loss by increasing or decreasing it.</li>
                                <li><strong>Do hair toppers damage your hair?</strong> Provided they are installed, maintained and removed gently and with care, hair toppers will not damage your existing, natural hair.</li>
                                <li><strong>Are hair toppers secure?</strong> If your hair topper is installed correctly with the right adhesive/attachment, you should not have any concerns about it not being secure and falling off.</li>

                            <p>With hair toppers in particular, it is best to choose a color that is closest to your natural hair color given that they only cover part of your hair. That said, there are bigger hair toppers that cover more of the scalp and in the end, it’s always down to one’s personal preference and how they would like their hair to look.</p>

                            <p>Similar to a wig or toupee or hairpiece, you can use glue or tape to attach your hair topper on your hair loss area whether it is a thinning crown or the top of your head. Using either will allow the hair system to stay flat on your scalp compared to toppers that are attached with clips.</p>

                                <li><strong>Do I use tape or glue to attach hair toppers?</strong> You can use either tape or glue to attach your hair topper depending on which type of adhesive is most comfortable on your scalp.</li>
                                <li><strong>How do I attach a hair topper with clips?</strong> Simply open the clips, apply the hair topper on the area where you are thinning or balding and clip them on to your natural hair. Make sure the clips have silicon strips so they protect your hair and prevent potential slippage.</li>
                                <li><strong>How do you secure a hair topper without clips?</strong> You can use glue or tape to attach your hair topper if you prefer not to use clips as they can be bulky if not attached or blended properly. If your hair topper comes with clips, you should be able to remove the clips without affecting the overall hairpiece.</li>

                                Wigs are a type of hair replacement system designed to cover the full head and provide the wearer with full hair coverage. These hairpieces are typically worn by women given the length, however, men can also wear wigs as well.
                            </p>   
                            <p>Superhairpieces offers a wide range of natural looking, comfortable and durable human hair wigs for women. This includes full lace and lace front women’s wigs in a variety of colors, textures and styles so you have one that exactly suits your needs.</p>

                            <p>Given that most of our wigs for sale are either full lace wigs or lace front wigs, you may be wondering — which one is better?</p>
                            <p>Both are similar in that they provide a natural looking front hairline, are easy to install and can last a long time if maintained properly. The differences, however, are that a lace front only provides a natural look in the front hairline while a full lace is natural throughout the hairpiece. However, because of this, full lace wigs for women tend to be more expensive than lace front wigs.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, full lace wigs may lack the durability of a lace front wig which can utilize a monofilament top for example. So in the end, it all depends on your needs and budget.</p>

                                It's important to use wig shampoo or shampoos that are specifically designed or compatible with hair systems. This is because regular shampoos strip the oils that are present in our hair. However, our scalp produces oils such as sebum that replenishes our hair and keeps it moisturized and hydrated. This is not present in a hair system as the hair is connected to a base material. The end result is your hair system getting dry and straw-like.
                             </p>
                             <p>In addition, the chemicals in certain shampoos are not compatible with some hair systems. For example, silicone-based hair products have an oily film which can loosen the knots to the base, especially with lace hair systems, resulting in hair shedding. And so, it’s always recommended to use a hair system or wig shampoos.</p>
                             <h3>Can you use regular shampoo to wash a wig?</h3>
                             <p>You can certainly use a regular shampoo on your wigs and toupees. You just need to make sure the shampoo doesn't have chemicals like parabens, sulfates and phthalates which can damage your hair. Additionally, avoid silicone-based products if you’re wearing a lace hair system.</p>

                            <p>This depends on the wearer and the base material of the wig or hair system. In general, it's recommended to maintain and wash your hairpiece at least once a week or once every other week to keep it odor-free and in good condition.</p>
                            <h3>How do you wash a human hair wig without wig shampoo?</h3>
                            <p>When it comes to washing a wig without wig shampoo, the process is the same as washing your regular hair. If you’re wearing your hairpiece, apply shampoo on your hair once it’s rinsed and create a lather. Rinse it off after a few minutes and apply conditioner if desired.</p>
